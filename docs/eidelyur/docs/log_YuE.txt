What was done during 07/26/2017:

1) Document mcool2code.docx was finished.
2) frictionForce_LieOperatorsApproach.py code (fFLOA) writing and debugging continued.

What was done during 07/27/2017:

1) The study of the criteria for eletron magnetization for code fFLOA:
      For each electrons during interaction more than 100 Larmour turns! OK!
2) Code fFLOA writing and debugging continued:
      a) Some problems with Python (creating matrix inside function);
      b) Something wrong with electron trajectory

What was done during 07/28/2017:

1) The study some new issues of Python.
2) Code fFLOA writing and debugging continued:
      a) Ok with trajectories;
      b) Prepering of the next step - friction force calculation.

What was done during 07/31/2017 - 08/01/2017:

1) The study some new issues of Python.
2) Code fFLOA writing and debugging continued:
      a) Friction force calculation using integration along the electron Larmour trajectory.

What was done during 08/02/2017 - 08/03/2017:

1) Brlliant overview (Mechkov) was investigated. This is his improved report for COOL2016. 
   I used the "trick", described by Igor (transition from 1.16 to 1.20) earlier (I wrote about it).
   Very interesting!
2) The study some new issues of Python.
3) Code fFLOA writing and debugging continued:
      a) "Games" with calculation of the friction force (FF) showed, how code must be changed 
         to correctly calculate  the FF for magnetized electrons; I did not place the "gaming" 
         version of the code to repository.

What was done during 08/11/2017:

1) Documents 'kinematicOfMagnetizedElectron.docx' and 
   'mapOfMaximalImpactParameter.docx' are finished. Resukts are included
   in new version of code ffLOA under new name frictionForceIntegration.py (fFI)
2) Code fFI under developing and debugging.

What was done during 08/16/2017  - 08/17/2017:

1) Development of the understanding of the range for impact parameters in case of the 
   finite lLarmor radius, if this radius is compatible with critical radius, radius of 
   the neutralization and/or Debye radius. 
2) Code fFI under developing and debugging.


What was done during 08/18/2017, 08/21/2017:

1) Code fFI under developing and debugging (first approach is near finishing).
